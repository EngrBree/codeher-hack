# Render Deployment Fix

## Issue Resolved
The deployment was failing due to `Pillow==9.5.0` build error with `KeyError: '__version__'` on newer Python versions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated requirements.txt
- Changed `Pillow==9.5.0` to `Pillow>=10.0.0`
- Added `gunicorn>=21.0.0` for production deployment

### 2. Added runtime.txt
- Specified Python version: `python-3.11.7`

### 3. Created render.yaml
- Configured proper build and start commands
- Set environment variables for production

### 4. Fixed app.py
- Created app instance for gunicorn compatibility
- Moved app creation outside `if __name__ == '__main__'`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the updated code to your repository**

2. **In Render Dashboard:**
   - Go to your service
   - Set the following environment variables:
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
     MYSQL_USER=your-mysql-username
     MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-mysql-password
     MYSQL_HOST=your-mysql-host
     MYSQL_DB=your-database-name
     FLASK_ENV=production
     ```

3. **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`

## Expected Result
The deployment should now succeed without the Pillow build error.

## Troubleshooting
If you still encounter issues:
1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Ensure your database is accessible from Render
3. Check the build logs for any remaining dependency issues
